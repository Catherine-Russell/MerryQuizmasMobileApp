# Project Description

This is my personal extension following a mini-project to create an Android App.
The project only lasted 2 days originally so we focused on embed what we had learned about Android Studio to create a simple Christmas-themed quiz with 5 random questions.
From this, I wanted to develop my understanding of how the different composables and pages interact and how information and functions are passed between different parts of the app.
Therefore, I decided to extend the project to introduce several new features, including scoring, hints and music.

Tech used:

* Kotlin
* Android Studio

# Demo

# Features
- User answers 5 randomly-generated quesitons
- The user is told whether they answered correctly or incorrectly
- If the user is incorrect, they are told the correct answer
- If the user is stuck, they can press the hint button to see a 'toast' message pop up
- The user is given a final score and hint count at the end
- User can toggle Christmassy theme music

# Key Areas of Learning

- **Git in Android Studio**: Learned to use Git in Android Studio to collaborate on a group project and use version control.

- **Kotlin**: After less than a week of learning Kotlin, I was able to put my new knowledge into practice and create an working project

- **Research**: Despite being new to Android Studio, I was able to use a variety of online resources and documentation to implement a range of different features
